###Portage
Portage is the amount of weight that an infantry unit can carry. Units have an Inherent Portage Capacity that limits their ability to carry support weapons. The weight of weapons is given in Portage Points.

####Inherent Portage Capacity (**IPC**)
Every infantry unit has an Inherent Portage Capacity that denotes the amount of Portage Points they can carry without penalty.

* MMC have 3 IPC
* SMC have 1 IPC

These IPC are additive, so a MMC+SMC stack has 4 IPC.

IPC has an important relationship with movement. If a unit is carrying more PP than its IPC, it is encumbered and has its Movement Factors reduced. For each PP over its IPC, a unit loses one MF.

####Portage Points
Support Weapons have a Portage Point value that reflects their weight and manueverability. 


####Portage Strategy
When planning moves with heavy weapons, you should always consider the impact of your portage on your movement. For intance, even a 3 PP MMG can significantly hamper a unit's movement if the unit decides to double time. The -1 IPC penalty for being CX would immediately eat up half the 2 MF benefit you would get from declaring a double time move.

Remember, too, that a unit can only rout away from Location carrying its IPC.
So, if you have a HMG nest that is compromised, you'll often be forced to leave
the machine gun behind when you rout, making it available for capture by your
opponent.
